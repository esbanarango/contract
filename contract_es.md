If your employees or other contractors will be working on the project along side us, we require that they also write tests for all code they produce to make sure we are all on the same page and not stepping on each others toes.

3. **Version Control**
Git will be used to keep track of all changes that happen in the application.... github pago.

Additional development
Any additional development needed above and beyond what we have agreed to here must be accompanied by an additional contract which we will be happy to provide upon request. We retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in this document.

Contact
All communications will be made during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm CST, excluding holidays) and we will return any contact requests within one business day unless we notify you ahead of time that we will be out of the office. Of course we understand that emergencies do arise, so in the case of one know that our hours will be billed at time and a half. We appreciate communication in a text-based medium, but understand that not all discussions are easily done this way. We’re happy to speak to you on the phone, over Skype/Google Hangout, or in person if you are in the [MY CITY] area, keeping in mind that any decisions that are made will be written down and require your written approval.

As we value your time as well as our own, we ask that all meetings be scheduled a minimum of two business days in advance and be accompanied by an agenda so that we can be fully prepared. If we are unable to attend a meeting at your suggested time, we will be happy to provide two times that will work for us. Meetings must start and end on or before the time allotted and will be charged for whether you attend or not.

Project Management
If you do not have a preferred project management tool, we will provide you with a login for ours where you will be able to see the status of the project down to the specific task, so you will always be kept up to date. We’ll be relying on you to participate by answering our questions, stating your approval, requesting changes, and verifying completeness through the tool as well. We ask for a one business day turnaround time on responses so we can keep things moving along at a pace that will allow us to hit the milestones we decided on together. 
To keep the project organized and the management of it easier, we prefer not to communicate any of the information stated above over ordinary email.
